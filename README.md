# Personal Website

A Personal Website for myself that I built from scratch using the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) framework. The purpose of the website is to log my personal achievements as well as give insight into me as a person, i.e. my hobbies, interests, and career goals.

## Development server
