<h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
<p>
  Through the Google Summer of Code (<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a>) program, I was accepted to spend the summer 
  working on an open source project for the organization Global Alliance for Genomics and Health 
  (<a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/">GA4GH</a>). The project was titled 
  "<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6402356590149632">Global Filesystem and Search Engine for Genomics Data</a>",
  whose goal was to create a generic API on top of existing object storage systems so workflow systems can access data in a single, 
  standard way regardless of where it's stored. Documentation and technical details of the project can be found at this
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ekeilty17/bef6562cbb65e71df844f32013454d91">gist file</a>.
  The API implementation can be found on my github in the repository titled <a href="https://github.com/ekeilty17/GA4GH-DOS-Server">GA4GH-DOS-Server</a>.

  GA4GH have developed the Data Object Service (DOS), which is an emerging API standard for specifying location of data across
  different cloud environments. I created is an implementation of a DOS Server, which hosts and allows the discovery of data
  objects. By completing this project I learned how to use the Springboot framework to build an API, how to connect a MYSQL
  database to an API, how to connect Keycloak authentication to an API, how to package it using Maven, and how to integrate 
  a backend such as the DOS Server to a UI.
